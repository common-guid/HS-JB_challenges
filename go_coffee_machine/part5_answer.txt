/*
Write a program that continuously makes coffee for everyone until the shutdown command is provided. 
Introduce two new options: remaining and exit.

Do not forget that you can overstretch your supplies while making coffee. 
If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message saying that it can't 
make it anymore and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if users enter buy to buy a cup of coffee but change their mind afterward, 
allow them to input back to return to the main menu.

For a start, the coffee machine has $550, 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, and 9 disposable cups.
