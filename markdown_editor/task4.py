"""
Implement the ordered-list and unordered-list formatters. You may want to separate the implementation
    into two different functions, but we suggest keeping them in one; try to get an idea of how to do it!

As in the previous stage, ask a user to input a formatter: Choose a formatter. Keep all the
    functions you implemented in the previous stage and add two new ones: ordered-list and unordered-list.

Both of the new formatters should require the following input:

Number of rows: > 3
Row #1: > First element
Row #2: > Second element
Row #3: > Third element
The number of rows should be greater than zero. If it is not, print the message
    The number of rows should be greater than zero and ask the user for input again.
